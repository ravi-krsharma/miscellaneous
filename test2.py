# Write a script to add copyright notices to all files in a directory.
#
# The script should take two arguments: a directory to search, and a file

# containing the text of the notice. It should add the notice to all files  
# that do not already contain it, skipping binary files and subdirectories.

# The script should be able to handle a reasonably large number of files.
# (Hint: use os.walk to find files, and the filecmp module to compare files.)
